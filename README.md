# PingMiner
Pings a remote machine once per minute and sends an alert when it doesn't respond.

In config.txt Put the IP of the machine to be pinged/watched on the first line and the pushbullet access key on the second line. 
That will auto-populate the two textboxes when you start up.

You will need to set up a pushbullet account and put the pushbullet app on your phone. You can customize your notifications on your phone.

Use this how you like, make alterations etc for your own use.
